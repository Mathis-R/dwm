dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

## Patches applied :
- swallow patch (sxiv and mpv run on top of the terminal
- systray patch (for discord / obs ...)
- xrdb patch (dwm will read the colors from .Xresources)
- Fullgaps patch (to change the gaps size dynamically)
- Shiftview patch (to change to the previous / next tag)
- resize corner patch (by default dwm use the bottom right corner to resize the window, this patch will let you use the closer corner to your mouse)

When using pywal to create a new color scheme, press Modkey + F5 to update the color of dwm.
